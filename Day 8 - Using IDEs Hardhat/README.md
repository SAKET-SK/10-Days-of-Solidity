Now that we have had hands-on experience of building Solidity Smart Contracts from scratch, it is now time to move on from Remix and get adapted to the industry standards. Truffle and Hardhat are among industry's leading choice and offer advanced features for unit testing, connection to nodes and integration with frontend, amongst numerous others. in today's session, we'll be setting up and exploring some cool features of Hardhat that may come in handy as a Smart Contract developer.

Setting Up The Hardhat Environment:
- In order to make the most out of this tutorial, we will be connecting our Hardhat environment with our very own node (from Alchemy) and our MetaMask wallet.Basic DependenciesPlease go ahead and install VSCode and NodeJs from the respective hyperlinks:
- VSCode is the recommended text editor
- NodeJs is the recommended Javascript runtime

Setting up Alchemy App:
- Alchemy is a node service provider that lets you connect to the ethereum network easily. So go and quickly set up your own free alchemy account and come back.
- Alchemy gives you the ability to read and write on the blockchain via their infrastructure. 
- It saves you time. It saves you money and keeps things efficient. Let‚Äôs sign up at Alchemy, get your free account, and follow the instructions below.
- Sign up for your free account and get to create an app.
- Chain - Ethereum
- Network - Goerli

- Your API key and HTTP address is important, save it somewhere for now, and we will use it in our project later.

Creating ü¶ä Metamask wallet:
- Your metamask wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a MetaMask account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.
- Metamask has a mobile application and a Chrome browser extension too. I personally use Metamask on my Chrome browser extension because I do most of the work on my laptop.
- Anyways, let‚Äôs go!Here are the installation steps:
1) Go to MetaMask.io
2) Click Download and Install the Chrome Extension.
3) Setup your secure password.
4) The next step is the most important one.
Secure your 12-word phrase properly, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

- Congrats! your account is created and you must have received a public address. 
- The public address will be in the pattern of: Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C
- You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store Ethereum based tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. 
- But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?
- Yes, it is completely safe. You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store Ethereum based crypto.


Changing your network on Metamask:
- We will not be using the live/production environment at the moment because it will be expensive to deploy a contract. 
- You will need some real ETH to do that! And of course, learning and deploying contracts on production for the purpose of learning is not sustainable.

- We will switch to Goerli Network, which is a test network that pretty much is a simulation of Ethereum blockchain production. Just open the extension of MetaMask and switch your network to Goerli. Just like in the above image. But if you are not able to see the Goerli Network.Here are the steps to turn on test networks
1) Go to settings
2) Open Advanced
3) Scroll down to Show Test Networks
4) Turn on

Get some fake ETH $$ ü§ë:
- Try the following website and try to get some fake ETHs. This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. 
- This is not real money, you can‚Äôt buy NFTs, or other assets via these ETH.
- All you have to do is to drop your public address on the following links and the ETH will be transferred.
- https://goerlifaucet.com/

Get your private ü¶ä Metamask key:
- Open the Metamask extension to find your private key. 
- While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. 
- Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

![b5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60461421/197396795-e06a1636-9032-448b-8283-9ec39af8bdaa.png)

- Keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export the private key and paste it somewhere secure.
- üö® DON‚ÄôT COMMIT YOUR PRIVATE KEY ON GITHUB, DON‚ÄôT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON‚ÄôT SHARE IT ANYWHERE!IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.
- üö®BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!


Setting Up Hardhat:
- Blockchain is like a public database and our smart contracts live on that database. 
- This database is publicly available and accessible. Based on our contract‚Äôs configuration, anyone or only specific people can play around with our contract. 
- Every time we publish a contract on blockchain, it gets an address - a digital footprint for us to track it. 
- We‚Äôll build everything in the Ethereum Blockchain and also use Solidity and other libraries for this project.
- Publishing a contract directly on blockchain for learning purposes will be an expensive deal. Every time we create a new contract, edit the contract or publish it on the blockchain, we incur some cost in the form of ETH, or MATIC. 
- In order to avoid that and test the contracts properly, we will create a test environment which pretty much replicates the production environment, is free to use, and easy to access.For this purpose, we will use HardHat. Hardhat gives you a local Ethereum network designed for rapid development. 
- It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code without spending a dime. How cool is that? üòäSo let‚Äôs install it using this command

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

- You can check out the hardhat documentation for any help with installation.
- Awesome, now let‚Äôs set up hardhat by running this command inside our project folder.

```
npx hardhat
```

- Since we will be constructing this project from scratch. Just create an empty hardhat config file during installation.

üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.11.2 üë∑‚Äç
? What do you want to do? - Create an empty hardhat.config.js
‚ú® Config file created ‚ú®
```

- Hardhat will produce a hardhat.config.js file with the following similar-looking code:

```
/**
* @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
*/
module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.17",
};
```

- Once you have installed hardhat, quickly create 2 new directories - contracts and scripts in your root directory using these commands. 
- The contracts directory will have all your smart contracts and the scripts directory will have all the scripts related to deployment of the contract.

```
mkdir contracts
mkdir scripts
```

- For this tutorial we are going to use the Ethers.js, Waffle and Open Zeppelin plugins. They allow us to interact with Ethereum, test contracts and use boilerplate code, respectively. To install them, in your project directory run:

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai
npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades
```

- Now import hardhat-waffle and openzeppelin by adding it to the top of your hardhat.config.js file using the following code:

```
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require('@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades');
```

- Since hardhat-waffle is dependent on hardhat-ethers, adding both isn't necessary.


Connect Hardhat to Metamask wallet, Alchemy Node and Goerli Network:
- It's time to bring it all together. We first need to connect our Hardhat project to our Metamask wallet and Alchemy node. For this purpose, create an empty ".env" text file in the root of your project. 
- Add in your API_URL and PRIVATE_KEY in the following format:

```
API_URL = YOUR_ALCHEMY_APP_URL
PRIVATE_KEY = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

- **ALWAYS KEEP THIS FILE PRIVATE AND REMEMBER TO NEVER PUSH IT IN YOUR GIT COMMITTS.**
- We now need to connect Hardhat to our ".env". Navigate to hardhat.config.js and add the following code on top to achieve this:

```
require('dotenv').config();
```

- Also declare the constants for API_URL and PRIVATE_KEY after the "require" statements as follows:

```
const { API_URL, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
```

- Our Hardhat project is now connected to our Alchemy node and Metamask Wallet. 
- One last bit remaining is the connection to Goerli network using our Metamask Wallet and Alchemy node. 
- We can achieve this in module.exports by declaring the defaultNetwork as Goerli and passing in our API_URL and PRIVATE_KEY parameters as follows in the hardhat.config.js:

```
module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.17",
    defaultNetwork: "goerli",
    networks: {
        hardhat: {},
        goerli: {
            url: API_URL,
            accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
        }
    },
};
```

- The final hardhat.config.js should look similar to this:

```
require('dotenv').config();
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require('@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades');
const { API_URL, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
/**
* @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
*/
module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.17",
    defaultNetwork: "goerli",
    networks: {
        hardhat: {},
        goerli: {
            url: API_URL,
            accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
        }
    },
};
```

- We are all set up with Hardhat. One last bit remaining though. How do we play around with Smart Contracts using Hardhat? 
- We have learnt how to write a Smart Contract. Unit Testing via Hardhat is a matter we will explore later. What we are left with is deploying a contract using Hardhat. 
- For the purpose of this tutorial, we will utilize our Hello World contract from Day 4. For brushing up here's how it looked like:

Hello World Smart Contract:
- Copy of the Hello World contract from Day 4:

```
//SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
        
contract HelloWorld {
    event messagechanged(string oldmsg, string newmsg);
    string public message;
                
    constructor(string memory firstmessage) {
        message = firstmessage;   
    }
            
    function update(string memory newmesssage) public {
        string memory oldmsg = message;
        message = newmesssage;
        emit messagechanged(oldmsg, newmesssage);
    }
}
```

Deploying the Smart Contract:
- When it comes to deploying, there are no official plugins that implement a deployment system for Hardhat yet. 
- In this regard, we need to write our own customer script to pursue this process. 
- First, place a copy of HelloWorld.sol in the contracts folder we created. 
- Then, start off by creating a deploy.js file in the scripts folder of your project we created earlier. 
- If you wish to jump directly to the final code, it should look similar to this:

```
async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
    console.log('Deploying contracts with the account:', deployer.address);
    console.log('Account balance:', (await deployer.getBalance()).toString());
    const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory('HelloWorld');
    const token = await Token.deploy("Hello World");
    console.log('Token address:', token.address);
}
        
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
  });
```

Let's run through step-by-step:
- We first need to access the Ethereum wallet. We do this via ethers.getSigners(). A Signer in Ethers.js is an object that represents an Ethereum account. It's used to send transactions to contracts and other accounts. Here we're getting a list of the accounts in the node we're connected to, which in this case is Hardhat Network, and only keeping the first one (our own Metamask wallet)
- We now use console.log as a way to emit the deployer address and wallet balance for our own record-keeping
- We then access the machine-readable format of the contract (ABI) by passing in the name of our contract: HelloWorld in ethers.getContractFactory
- Lastly, our contract constructor requires passing in some initial initial for deployment. We pass in HelloWorld for now in Token.deploy
- We now use console.log again to know the address of our deployed contract
- As a good programming practice, we add in boilerplate error handling in case the deployment fails.

- Now, navigate back to the root of the project and in the terminal run the following command:
``` 
npx hardhat node
``` 

- Now open another terminal in the root and run: 
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

- You will now receive the Goerli Contract Address and your smart contract is now deployed.
- For an Aha! moment, explore your deployed contract by searching for the newly generated Contract Address on the Goerli Testnet ExplorerYou have made it till here. Give a tap on your back and we shall return tomorrow with a deep-dive on writing unit tests using Hardhat. Happy coding!
